# Commit Plan for Critical Fixes

## Commit 1: fix(auth): replace Redis panic with proper error handling

**Files**:
- services/auth-service/internal/database/database.go
- services/auth-service/cmd/main.go

**Message**:
```
fix(auth): replace Redis panic with proper error handling

BREAKING: NewRedisClient now returns (*redis.Client, error) instead of *redis.Client

- Replace panic() with proper error return in NewRedisClient
- Update main.go to handle Redis connection errors gracefully
- Prevent application crash when Redis connection fails
- Add proper error logging for Redis connection issues

Fixes critical bug where application would crash on Redis failure.
This is a production-critical fix.
```

## Commit 2: fix(services): add panic recovery for background goroutines

**Files**:
- services/exercise-service/internal/service/exercise_service.go
- services/course-service/internal/service/course_service.go

**Message**:
```
fix(services): add panic recovery for background goroutines

- Add defer/recover wrapper for handleExerciseCompletion goroutine
- Add defer/recover wrapper for handleLessonCompletion goroutine
- Log panic events for debugging
- Prevent application crash from background task failures

Fixes critical bug where panic in service-to-service integration
could crash the entire application. Main app now continues running
even if background notification/progress update tasks fail.
```

- docs/SYSTEM_AUDIT_REPORT.md
