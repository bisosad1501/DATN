## üîç KI·ªÇM TRA LOGIC NGHI·ªÜP V·ª§ C·ª§ TH·ªÇ

### 1. Enrollment Logic
```
GIVEN: User A, Course B (published)
WHEN: User A enrolls in Course B
THEN:
  - Enrollment record created with status "active"
  - Progress initialized at 0%
  - Enrollment notification sent
  - Cannot enroll twice in same course
```

### 2. Lesson Completion Logic
```
GIVEN: User A enrolled in Course B, Lesson L
WHEN: User A completes Lesson L
THEN:
  - Lesson progress marked complete
  - User overall progress += 1 lesson
  - Course progress percentage updated
  - Study hours accumulated
  - Lesson completion notification sent
  - If all lessons complete ‚Üí Course completion notification
```

### 3. Exercise Grading Logic
```
GIVEN: Exercise E with 10 questions, each worth 1 point
WHEN: User submits 7 correct, 3 incorrect
THEN:
  - Score = 7/10 = 70%
  - If passing_score = 60% ‚Üí Status = "passed"
  - Skill statistics updated (if score > 0)
  - User progress += 1 exercise
  - Result notification sent
```

### 4. Skill Statistics Update
```
GIVEN: User has listening skill stats (avg=5.0, best=6.5)
WHEN: User completes listening exercise with score=7.0
THEN:
  - total_exercises_completed += 1
  - average_score = (5.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 6.0
  - best_score = max(6.5, 7.0) = 7.0
  - last_practice_at = now()
```

### 5. Achievement Unlock Logic
```
GIVEN: User completes 10 exercises (achievement threshold)
WHEN: User completes 10th exercise
THEN:
  - Achievement "First 10 Exercises" unlocked
  - Achievement notification sent
  - User achievement list updated
```
